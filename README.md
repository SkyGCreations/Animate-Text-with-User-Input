# Animate-Text-with-User-Input
This project allows user input to calculate their birth year. 
The click button invokes the Calculate Function() and returns a default animated text string
The default text string has a template literal embedded within it 
The template literal has a variable which calcualtes the user input Age
When user inputs thier age the data input will flow through a  number of IF conditions
Whichever If condition returns TRUE will execute a backgroundcolor change along with the 
animated text string with the users year of birth. Background color change will depend on user input age

If click button is pressed before user inputs their requested age, then input field will prompt user
to type their age into input field by invoking a background color and font-weight change within input field.

Reset button will clear the function Calculate().
